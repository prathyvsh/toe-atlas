* ToE Atlas: A catalogue of Theories of Everything

[[./img/toe-atlas-cover.png]]

This is a list of theories of everything that I have come across in my researches. I have been partial to theories/frameworks that have a mathematical/algorithmic formalism behind it and have mostly skipped theories which attempt to explain [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)#The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy][why 42?]], taking away this criteria is under consideration and it would allow me to add in a lot of philosophical works starting from Heraclitus/Parmenides to contemporary times. Some are not exactly theories of everything but architectonic systems that span more than two domains attempting to unify them. Whenever the ambit of reasoning seemed like it gave insights into unifying two+ disparate fields of knowledge, I have tried to include them here. I am a user interface design / software engineer by trade, so this listing is only partial and if you know of any exciting theories which I have left out, please send a PR or reach out via Twitter.

** Universality

Universality is considered to arise in a complex system which has many components that have strong interaction/coupling with each other. The term universality is used because the mathematical representation of certain systems at a particular resolution corresponds to the behaviour of other kinds of systems even though they have different underlying makeup. Whenever a system exhibits universality, the behaviour of the system can be treated like a random matrix. The pattern of spectrum plotted from a random matrix can be seen to matches up with the observed behaviour of the system.

This image from Yaneer Bar-Yam’s post “Why Complexity is Different” may help elucidate this concept where the same model maps onto a wide variety of phenomena:

#+CAPTION: Image illustration Universality
[[./img/universality.png]]


Systems with many interacting components such as biological species, bus systems, numbers, distribution of cones in the eyes of chicken, subatomic particles, all kept producing the same pattern known as the Tracy-Widom distribution. The microscopic collective behaviour results in a macroscopic behaviour which is same across a wide variety of phenomena and this is studied under universality.

While the central limit theorem shows that Gaussian normal distribution can appear among uncorrelated variables that does not mutually influence each other, Tracy-Widom seems to arise from variables that strongly interact with each other. In such systems that display universality, power laws represent the underlying distribution of interactions. The curve of such a distribution is said to be scale-invariant because they display the fractal like nature whereby a part of the curve is a mirror image of the whole. This GIF of the Koch Curve is a nice illustration of the phenomena. As you zoom into a part of the fractal, the same part reccurs.

#+CAPTION: Scale Invariance of the Koch Curve

An advantage of studying universality phenomena is that you get to use the same machinery you use to study one model in an entirely different context. Such contextual transfer of ideas from one domain to another is a central theme running throughout this repo.

#+CAPTION: Image from Quanta Magazine explaining the nature of hyperuniformity found in chicken eyes
[[./img/hyperuniformity-in-chicken-eyes.jpg]]

How 2-dimensional hyperuniformity was found inside the eyes of chicken. What happens in chicken’s eyes is that you get a distribution of five types of cones and these are trying to arrange themselves so that they are far apart from each other while leaving out room for the other cells to do so too. In this sense, they are interdependent and interact with each other so as to obtain an optimal packing which results in the universality pattern observed in other inorganic and physical systems.

It mentions an idea called maximally random jammed packing where this phenomena repeats which happens in the case of marbles. These are classified as non-equilibrium systems along with emulsions, colloids, ensembles of cold atoms. The other class is the equilibrium class which contains the avian color cones, distribution of eigenvalues of random matrices, zeroes of the Riemann zeta function, and quasicrystals.

These two mechanisms of territorial warfare between termite colonies and plant self-organization interact to generate this pattern.

Discusses the work of Torquato and team on attempting to find diffraction pattern of prime numbers and comparing it to diffraction pattern of quasicrystals.

Bragg peaks are produced when diffracting light off of crystals and quasicrystals.

This is how diffraction pattern of an inorganic crystal, a tantalum oxide looks:

#+CAPTION: Diffraction pattern of a tantalum oxide
[[./img/inorganic-crystal-diffraction-pattern.jpg]]

and this is how diffraction pattern of a quasicrystal looks like:

#+CAPTION: Diffraction pattern of an icosahedral Zn-Mg-Ho quasicrystal
[[./img/quasicrystal-diffraction-pattern.jpg]]

Torquato and team attempted to find the diffraction pattern of primes in the so called “Goldilocks Zone” to see how the pattern looks like and they found out that it can be described as effectively limit periodic. The distance between the peaks of fractions are fractional in prime number case as opposed to the quasicrystal case where it is irrational.

A link with Taylor-Socolar tiling is also mentioned in the article which exhibits limit periodicity: the system has periodic spacings nested in an infinite hierarchy; it contains parts of patterns of itself that repeat at large intervals. The effective limit periodicity of prime numbers is compared with this limit periodicity of the Taylor-Socolar tiling.

TODO: Find out the difference between effective limit periodicity and limit periodicity

Towards the end of the article, it notes Andrew Granville claiming that results Torquato and team have arrived at are just reframings of already known results.

*** History

Ken Wilson
Kadanoff
Already implicit in van der Waals equation and Landau Theory

Wigner hypothesized that all complex correlated systems will exhibit such universality

An interesting thread is how the [[https://github.com/prathyvsh/toe-atlas/#a-two-dimensional-growth-process][Eden model of bacterial growth]] identified by Murray Eden in 1961 was studied by Mehran Kardar, Giorgio Parisi, and Yi-Cheng Zhang in 1981. This model known as the [[https://github.com/prathyvsh/toe-atlas/#dynamic-scaling-of-growing-interfaces][KPZ equation]] was found to accurately describe irregular fluctations of the growth of bacteria population. This KPZ equation is conjectured to be the field theory of many surface growth models such as the Eden model, [[https://github.com/prathyvsh/toe-atlas/#ballistic-deposition][ballistic deposition]], and [[https://github.com/prathyvsh/toe-atlas/#growth-in-a-restricted-solid-on-solid-model][restricted solid on solid]], directed polymers, and [[https://github.com/prathyvsh/toe-atlas/#polynuclear-growth][polynuclear growth model]]. The SOS model case has been proved in the [[https://github.com/prathyvsh/toe-atlas/#stochastic-burgers-and-kpz-equations-from-particle-systems][Stochastic Burgers]] paper.

It also further turned out that the distribution of largest eigenvalue of an N × N matrix with entries being random numbers taken from a Gaussian distribution turned out to have a shape described by so called Tracy-Widom distribution.

This distribution is also found in the Ulam problem: a problem where you find out the longest increasing subsequence of permutations of a certain selection of integers. Ulam problem was raised by Stanisław Ulam in the 1960s.

For example, for a sequence with N = 6: { 1, 2, 4, 3, 6, 5 } you have { 1, 2, 4, 6 } as the long subsequence. The Ulam probelm is to determine for any N, the distribution of the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

Tracy-Widom was found to describe the distribution of the length of the longest increasing subsequences. By 2000s, an exact mapping was done between the Ulam problem and models of KPZ type showing their equivalence. This was found by [[https://github.com/prathyvsh/toe-atlas/#exact-scaling-functions-for-one-dimensional-stationary-kpz-growth][Prähofer and Spohn]], [[https://github.com/prathyvsh/toe-atlas/#shape-fluctations-and-random-matrices][Johansson]], and [[https://github.com/prathyvsh/toe-atlas/#limit-tehorems-for-height-fluctuations-in-a-class-of-discrete-space-and-time-growth-models][Gravner, Tracy, and Widom]].

There also seems to be a connection to a third-order phase transition connected with these problems and it is conjectured to closely linked to Gross-Witten-Wadia phase transition known from lattice gauge theories of quantum chromodynamics.

Reply from Barabási: https://www.barabasilab.com/post/love-is-all-you-need

* Emergence

Emergence occurs in complex systems. Complex systems have interactions such as feedback loops across the elements in the system which creates many phenomena which doesn’t allow to reduce/partition the structure/operation of the components into subcomponents. For this reason, emergence is commonly pitted against the philosophy of reductionism. The web of interactions between the components generate many properties such as robustness of the system against perturbations of various factors which could cause collapse of the ecosystem.

One of the key ideas when working complex systems is identifying the signficant properties of the system, which itself might turn out to be a dynamic set of properites of the system as seen in this essay by Yaneer Bar-Yam: https://mystudentvoices.com/why-complexity-is-different-ecd498e0eccb In order to study a system successfully, we need to be able to separate them along various scales and identify the stable structures and behaviours at each scale.

In a complex system there could be interactions at the large scale that affect the smaller scale and reciprocally, ones at the smaller scale that have large scale repercussions.

Understanding complex systems is situated at this boundary between totally random behaviour and totally uniform behaviour. It is best described using scales.

TODO: Figure out the relation between Galois Theory, Closures, Renormalization and Emergence.

Russ Abbott
2008
2 pages

This is an interesting paper where Abbott wonders why philosophers find emergence mysterious while computer scientists find it common place. He says almost all the activity in computer science when building abstractions is generating emergence effects. He presents a dictionary of terms in this essay where he draws duality between terms used in computer science and philosophy:

| Computer Science                     | Philosophy    |
|--------------------------------------+---------------|
| Abstraction                          | Emergence     |
| Implementation                       | Reduction     |
| Specification-Implementation         | Autonomy      |
| Type                                 | Kind          |
| Execution                            | Causality     |
| Object                               | Individual    |
| Functional Dependency                | Supervenience |

Reading this paper made me think about the predicative/constructive duality as it happens in Computer science. In the former paradigm, you are required to find the conditions/constraints under which a certain phenomena occurs roughly in a top down fashion, where as in the constructive paradigm, you construct the entity bottom up. Both really lead to capture the same forms/phenomena happening in a certain domain/realm, but it enables you to think in a different mode. Perhaps such a mode difference is present between the styles of thinking prevalent in philosophy (predicative) and computer science (constructive).

TODO: Wonder how this conceptual/computational dichotomy between philosophy and computer science is connected to the predicative/constructive, intension/extension, structure/operation dualities. If/when I spot the connections, I have to make them rigorous by showing examples.

* Self Organized Criticality

The model says that complex systems teeters on the border of order and disorder. This term has been famously called the "edge of chaos". This idea has been extended to cover earthquakes, financial markets, traffic jams, biological evolution, the distribution of galaxies in the universe, and human brain.

** Critical Brain Hypothesis

Balancing exactly at the critical point might be unstable which lead researchers to formulate theories of subcritical/quasicritical brain.

** Renormalization

A mathematical technique that was developed to address the phase transition problem (TODO: What is it?). It allows for travelling? through scales and understanding the behaviour across each of these levels. It allows for segmenting the relevant parameters for interactions at a particular scale from the irrelevant. Relevant parameters increase with scale and irrelevant parameters decrease (TODO: Is this usually the case?)

** Deep Learning as Renormalization

Extracting relevant features in systems with varying degrees of coupling with the use of tools from statistics, physics, and computation. Parallels are drawn between how the process of renormalization picks out the significant features of a data set and how deep learning Boltzmann machines picks out features of objects to identify it from various angles.

Relevant concepts: Autoencoder, Boltzmann Machine, Sparse Coding, Universal Approximation Theorem, Information Bottleneck

Boltzmann Machine
The name borrows from Austrian scientist Boltzmann whose work on statistical mechanics of gas molecules enabled him to discover the gas equation [link]. The way these deep learning machines converge is essentially the same equation (Verify/Corroborate with link/screenshot).

The idea in renormalization whereby information is reduced to its essence where the correlation between elements is reduced to a minimum is shown to be equivalent to what deep learning does with artificial neurons.

Describes the work of Geoffrey Hinton and Terry Sejnowski and how that lead to David Schwab while watching a lecture to draw an analogy with renormalization. Schwab with his collaborator Pankaj Mehta, worked out the details in a paper that made this intuition rigorous.

*** Galois Theory

Connection between Galois Theory in number theory, complex analysis, and quantum field theory has been noticed. In particular, the idea of renormalization and motives has been discovered by Alain Connes and Kreimer.
