* ToE Atlas: A catalogue of Theories of Everything

[[./img/toe-atlas-cover.png]]

This is a list of theories of everything that I have come across in my researches. I have been partial to theories/frameworks that have a mathematical/algorithmic formalism behind it and have mostly skipped theories which attempt to explain [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)#The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy][why 42?]], taking away this criteria is under consideration and it would allow me to add in a lot of philosophical works starting from Heraclitus/Parmenides to contemporary times. Some are not exactly theories of everything but architectonic systems that span more than two domains attempting to unify them. Whenever the ambit of reasoning seemed like it gave insights into unifying two+ disparate fields of knowledge, I have tried to include them here. I am a user interface design / software engineer by trade, so this listing is only partial and if you know of any exciting theories which I have left out, please send a PR or reach out via Twitter.

Style Guide:
Try to provide a character sketch of the person who invented the theory where possible
Link to papers, articles, and books of the corresponding theory
When linking a paper, include title, authors, date of publishing, number of pages, and a brief description if you have skimmed/read the paper
The schema is roughly:

** Universality

Universality is considered to arise in a complex system which has many components that have strong interaction/coupling with each other. Whenever a system exhibits universality, the behaviour of the system can be treated like a random matrix. The pattern of spectrum plotted from a random matrix can be seen to matches up with the observed behaviour of the system.

Systems with many interacting components such as biological species, bus systems, numbers, distribution of cones in the eyes of chicken, subatomic particles, all kept producing the same pattern known as the Tracy-Wiidom distribution. The microscopic collective behaviour results in a macroscopic behaviour which is same across a wide variety of phenomena and this is studied under universality.

While the central limit theorem shows that Gaussian normal distribution can appear among uncorrelated variables that does not mutually influence each other, Tracy-Widom seems to arise from variables that strongly interact with each other.

** Levy Stable distributions

** Zipf’s Law

Distribution that is present when there are many entities clustering to form fewer number of compound entities. This distribution is present in a lot of wide varieties of distribution such as in languages, economic distribution, and nature. Zipf’s law is witnessed when the system shows criticality.

*** Tracy Widom Distribution

Turns up in systems with a mixture of weakly and strongly coupled components. The feedback loops of mutual effects leads to an asymmetric distribution which is skewed more on the left side than the right. This distribution can also be interpreted operationally as one that represents a phase transition from a weakly coupled state of the system to a strongly coupled one.
