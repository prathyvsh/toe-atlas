* ToE Atlas: A catalogue of Theories of Everything

[[./img/toe-atlas-cover.png]]

This is a list of theories of everything that I have come across in my researches. I have been partial to theories/frameworks that have a mathematical/algorithmic formalism behind it and have mostly skipped theories which attempt to explain [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)#The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy][why 42?]], taking away this criteria is under consideration and it would allow me to add in a lot of philosophical works starting from Heraclitus/Parmenides to contemporary times. Some are not exactly theories of everything but architectonic systems that span more than two domains attempting to unify them. Whenever the ambit of reasoning seemed like it gave insights into unifying two+ disparate fields of knowledge, I have tried to include them here. I am a user interface design / software engineer by trade, so this listing is only partial and if you know of any exciting theories which I have left out, please send a PR or reach out via Twitter.

Style Guide:
Try to provide a character sketch of the person who invented the theory where possible
Link to papers, articles, and books of the corresponding theory
When linking a paper, include title, authors, date of publishing, number of pages, and a brief description if you have skimmed/read the paper

** Universality

Universality is considered to arise in a complex system which has many components that have strong interaction/coupling with each other. The term universality is used because the mathematical representation of certain systems at a particular resolution corresponds to the behaviour of other kinds of systems even though they have different underlying makeup. Whenever a system exhibits universality, the behaviour of the system can be treated like a random matrix. The pattern of spectrum plotted from a random matrix can be seen to matches up with the observed behaviour of the system.

This image from Yaneer Bar-Yam’s post “Why Complexity is Different” may help elucidate this concept where the same model maps onto a wide variety of phenomena:

Systems with many interacting components such as biological species, bus systems, numbers, distribution of cones in the eyes of chicken, subatomic particles, all kept producing the same pattern known as the Tracy-Widom distribution. The microscopic collective behaviour results in a macroscopic behaviour which is same across a wide variety of phenomena and this is studied under universality.

While the central limit theorem shows that Gaussian normal distribution can appear among uncorrelated variables that does not mutually influence each other, Tracy-Widom seems to arise from variables that strongly interact with each other.

Turns up in systems with a mixture of weakly and strongly coupled components.

* Emergence

Emergence occurs in complex systems. Complex systems have interactions such as feedback loops across the elements in the system which creates many phenomena which doesn’t allow to reduce/partition the structure/operation of the components into subcomponents. For this reason, emergence is commonly pitted against the philosophy of reductionism. The web of interactions between the components generate many properties such as robustness of the system against perturbations of various factors which could cause collapse of the ecosystem.

One of the key ideas when working complex systems is identifying the signficant properties of the system, which itself might turn out to be a dynamic set of properites of the system as seen in this essay by Yaneer Bar-Yam: https://mystudentvoices.com/why-complexity-is-different-ecd498e0eccb In order to study a system successfully, we need to be able to separate them along various scales and identify the stable structures and behaviours at each scale.

In a complex system there could be interactions at the large scale that affect the smaller scale and reciprocally, ones at the smaller scale that have large scale repercussions.

Understanding complex systems is situated at this boundary between totally random behaviour and totally uniform behaviour. It is best described using scales.

TODO: Figure out the relation between Galois Theory, Closures, Renormalization and Emergence.

Russ Abbott
2008
2 pages

This is an interesting paper where Abbott wonders why philosophers find emergence mysterious while computer scientists find it common place. He says almost all the activity in computer science when building abstractions is generating emergence effects. He presents a dictionary of terms in this essay where he draws duality between terms used in computer science and philosophy:

| Computer Science                     | Philosophy    |
+======================================+===============+
| Abstraction                          | Emergence     |
| Implementation                       | Reduction     |
| Specification-Implementation         | Autonomy      |
| Type                                 | Kind          |
| Execution                            | Causality     |
| Object                               | Individual    |
| Functional Dependency                | Supervenience |

Reading this paper made me think about the predicative/constructive duality as it happens in Computer science. In the former paradigm, you are required to find the conditions/constraints under which a certain phenomena occurs roughly in a top down fashion, where as in the constructive paradigm, you construct the entity bottom up. Both really lead to capture the same forms/phenomena happening in a certain domain/realm, but it enables you to think in a different mode. Perhaps such a mode difference is present between the styles of thinking prevalent in philosophy (predicative) and computer science (constructive).

TODO: Wonder how this conceptual/computational dichotomy between philosophy and computer science is connected to the predicative/constructive, intension/extension, structure/operation dualities. If/when I spot the connections, I have to make them rigorous by showing examples.
